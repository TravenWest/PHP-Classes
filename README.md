# PHP-Classes

Free open source classes which I use in PHP web applications.

### Other Information

As I develop my skills in PHP, I will be posting more code snippets and useful classes that can be adapted across web applications. Some classes may just be pulled from a web application, and will need to be modified to fit a more generalized setup. I hope that someone may find use of these one day.
